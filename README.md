# Elevator-Simulation

## Description
The 'Elevator-Simulation' project is a simulation model of an elevator system designed to mimic real-world elevator operations. It provides a realistic simulation environment to study and analyze the behavior and efficiency of elevator systems in different scenarios.

## Key Features
- **Realistic Simulation:** Models the behavior of an elevator system in a multi-story building, including passenger requests, elevator movement, and door operations.
- **Multiple Elevators:** Supports simulation of multiple elevators operating within the same building.
- **Scheduling Algorithms:** Implements various elevator scheduling algorithms to optimize efficiency and reduce wait times.
- **User Interface:** Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize the elevator operations and monitor system performance.
- **Custom Scenarios:** Allows users to create custom scenarios and configure parameters such as the number of floors, number of elevators, and passenger arrival rates.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Java
- **GUI Framework:** JavaFX
- **Simulation Framework:** Custom-built using Java for simulation logic

## Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
   \`\`\`sh
   git clone https://github.com/MomenMushtaha/Elevator-Simulation.git
   \`\`\`
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   \`\`\`sh
   cd Elevator-Simulation
   \`\`\`
3. **Compile the Java files:**
   \`\`\`sh
   javac -d bin src/*.java
   \`\`\`
4. **Run the simulation:**
   \`\`\`sh
   java -cp bin Main
   \`\`\`

## Usage
- **Simulation Configuration:** Edit the configuration file to set parameters such as the number of floors, number of elevators, and passenger arrival patterns.
- **Running the Simulation:** Use the GUI to start and stop the simulation, view elevator movements, and analyze performance metrics.
